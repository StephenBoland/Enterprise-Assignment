MEAN Stack was used for the project.
Therfore AngularJs, ExpressJs, NodeJs and MongoDb may be required to run this project if there are issues.
STEP 1: Use the command "npm install --save" to install the dependencies required for this project to run
STEP 2: Inside of the folder directory, open 2 terminals.
Terminal 1 : type the command "ng serve" to start a local development server - "http://localhost:4200/"
Terminal 2 : type the command "nodemon server.js" to connect to the database.
(I have left the connection to my private cluster in, presumably it will still connect)
Step 3: navigate to "http://localhost:4200/" to see the project.
